# Editing tools

There are plenty of editing tools to build API and software documentation. Which one to choose depends on the habits and skills of the technical and product team, as well as 
the end user persona : writing for a developer audience (documentation as code) implies having the documentation online, available ideally on both a static website with a nice and readable UI,
as well as on a Github repo that allows for updates and collective work.

I only focus here on documentation as code workflow, so all the tools I am going to talk mainly about editing tools that focus on publishing the documentation online.
