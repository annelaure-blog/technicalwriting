## [How to Build a DITA XML Technical Writing Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-build-a-dita-xml-technical-writing-portfolio)

This course can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-build-a-dita-xml-technical-writing-portfolio).
Below are my notes following the lesson step by step.

   ### Getting setup with Github and Oxygen XML Author

- Download and install Oxygen XML Author from [the Oxygen XML website](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_author/download_oxygenxml_author.html) using the trial licence key that is available for 30 days
- To showcase your technical skills and ability to work with developers, it is a good thing to build a DITA XML documentation portfolio and to have it available on a public Github repository. To do so,  you would have to create an account (if you don't have one already) on Github. If you already have a Github account, you can  [create a new public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) right away.

  ### The workflow steps

- CONCEPTION : What are the main features of the app or the software I am writing the documentation of ? We start by making a simple list of main functions.
- WRITING : Write the content with DITA XML
- PRODUCTION : Generate a PDF file and HTML5 content from the DITA source
- PUBLICATION : Share the content with the end user

  ### Creating a DITA map with Oxygen XML Author

DITA means Darwin Information Typing Architecture. 
DITA is a Component Content Management System (CCMS).

> "A content model is an architectural framework for a collection of content, representing the structure of the data to be stored. In a structured authoring sense, a content model is a high level plan of the types of information and an appropriate structure for its storage. For example, the content model for a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) of a manual might describe a hierarchy of topics, broken down into title, question, background, and answer.
When we design an information architecture for storing information (or a structure to suit our documentation), we are creating a content (or information) model.
Top-level elements in DITA content models are topic types (or information types). A typical procedure manual may include procedure, explanation, glossary and error message information types. DITA's base content model (that is, the standard, default DITA model) defines three information types: **concept, task and reference**. These three types all inherit characteristics of a proto information type, simply named topic. The following diagram shows the basic information types."

Visit the [DITA Style Guide by Oxygen XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/styleguide/webhelp-feedback/#Artefact/Topics_and_Information_Types/c_Content_Models_and_Info_Types.html) for a complete set of definitions and best practices.

Once Oxygen XML is open :
- Create a DITA map by clicking on "file", then "new", then by selecting "DITA map" and by naming your new file with a relevant name
- Create a dedicated folder for your work on the desktop of your computer and make sure all files created in this exercice are included in it
- Create  topic heads elements within this map by right clicking on our new map title, then "append child", then "Topic head"
- Save your work (Crtl S)

  ### Designing your content 

Content in DITA can be divided into 4 categories : 
- **topics (general descriptions)** </br>
    - **concepts** (specific thing to know about a topic), </br>
    - **tasks** (step by step, how to),</br>
    - **references** (norms, tables, index...).</br>

Each page of the documentation should help the users address one specific question. People tend to search on search engines with by questions, such as "how to group items in Illustrators". The basic template to follow is :
- **Question** :  "How to create a clipping mask in Adobe Illustrator ?"
- **Answer** : Follow the steps indicated to create a clipping mask in Adobe Illustrator
- **Definition** : A clipping mask is an object whose shape masks other artwork so that only areas that lie within the shape are visibleâ€”in effect, clipping the artwork to the shape of the mask. It is a useful way of creating the look of "cropping" an image without having to move into Illustrator to create a true crop.
- **Prerequisite** : To sucessfully create a skimming mask, you must know how to create shapes and import images to Adobe Illustrator.
- **Steps** :
      - 1 : import one image to Illustrator
      - 2 : on the same layer, draw a shape (either a circle, rectangle or hand-draw shape with the pencil tool) that will be the contour of the skimming mask
      - 3 : select both the image and the shape by either clicking on both while maintaining "shift" or by dragging the mouse over 
      - 4 : do a right click, select "create a skimming mask" in the menu
- **Result** : the skimming mask is created

   
   ### Generate a PDF file and HTML 5 content
   
To export our DITA content, we must :
- select the DITA map in Oxygen
- click on the "Configure transformation scenario" icon
- choose HTML5 and PDF in the list of output formats
- click on "apply"

To improve the apparence of the content output, CSS would be required. At this stage, we focus only on the content.
Publishing the content must be done **only when the customer has approved the publication** to be shared with the end users.

The PDF file can be added to our Github Repository along with DITA XML files and the HTML file by adding https://htmlpreview.github.io/? before the file link so the end user can actually read the content.

## Course 2 : the art of API Documentation

This course can be found on Udemy [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-art-of-api-documentation/learn/lecture/4207186#overview). It is given by Peter Gruenbaum, President, SDK Bridge. It is the 3 out of 3 courses about API documentation.
See also, intro video : ["What is a REST API ?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsMQRaeKNDk&ab_channel=IBMTechnology)

### Introduction

API stands for Application Programming Interface. API defines how 2 pieces of software communicate with each other.
There are several types of API : the 2 most common are Web API (REST) and platform API.
API documentation are for developers. Good quality documentation will improve developers autonomy. 
Writers bring an important 

API documentation can be divided in 2 parts :
- conceptual : high level info such as 
      - an overview
          - explain why to use the API
          - requirements
          - key concepts
          - workflow (order of steps to do common tasks)
          - visual information (models diagrams)
          - a "getting started section"
              - For Web API : lead people through a simple task
                  - registration
                  - get an app key
                  - authorization
                  - making one or two http request that return a response
              - For Platform API :
                  - downloading the SDK (software development kit)
                  - setting up your Integrated Development environment (IDE)
                  - doing something simple
      - tutorials
           - step by step instructions, should start with simple tasks and gradually become more complex
           - sample code covers common tasks (lots of comments in them to explain how the code works)
           - sample code is different from production code
      - sample code
- reference : http request and references (methods, classes...)

#### Material of API documentation

The overview needs to explain the "why" and not just the "how".
Its important because developers need to know :
- what does the API do
- what does it require
- is it well designed ?
They need to know if this API can solve their problem or not.

- Explaining the why : describe key features, provide a few use cases
- Provide the list of requirements (might not be needed for web API)
- for Platforms API : what operating system, what language, what versions ?

For each concept, write a paragraph or two.
Workflow diagrams and architecture diagrams might help for visual persons within the overview section (explaining how the different pieces fit together).

### Tools for API documentation

- Postman : [https://www.postman.com/](https://www.postman.com/) is an app that allows you to make requests and see responses through a visual client.
