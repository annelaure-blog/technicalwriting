# Technical writing and software documentation : courses & notes

## What this repo is about

Hello ! My name is [Anne-Laure Freant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annelaurefreant/) and I am a content specialist with 10 years of experience in the field of tech 
(in Canada and in France) where I worked for either startups or state-level public institutions on digital products. I used to conduct editorial projects (blogs, SEO, UX writing) as well as translations of technical content (english to french, french to english) and data or code curation (reading and checking JSON files, completing metadata, etc.). So I already have a good set of skills in the field of tech, content and technical writing, and I got into the process of obtaining a technical writing certification in 2022 so to shift my career towards technical writing full time. My goal is to specialize in software, web apps and API documentation.

I share on this repo all my notes from the various trainings and courses I took to improve my technical writing skills as well as getting a technical writing certification. Feel free to browse through the content if you are looking for a specific set of skills, a specific topic or course.

As I was looking for online courses and certifications to improve my technical writing skills, I read several articles ranking the "best technical writing certifications" ( [1](https://www.squibler.io/blog/technical-writing-certification/), [2](https://productmanagerhq.com/technical-writing-certification/) ,[3](https://www.thecareerproject.org/blog/best-technical-writing-courses/)). Udemy might not the best place to start if you are looking for a full certificate or a complete initial training, but it is perfect to acquire some specific skills, assess your level and see more precisely what other trainings you might need according to your background and goals. It is a good way to test your interest for a very reasonable price before considering investing in a more expensive, longer certification.

As I already have a background in digital writing and technical content curation, I decided to start with a few Udemy courses that are relatively fast to complete (within a few days) but very specific to technical writing as well as based on real exercices. I then decided to go for the [Technical writing certification from HQ](https://technicalwriterhq.com/technical-writing-certification/) for a complete training and official certification.

### Udemy courses

#### How to Build a DITA XML Technical Writing Portfolio

This course can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-build-a-dita-xml-technical-writing-portfolio).
Below are my notes following the lesson step by step.

##### Getting setup with Github and Oxygen XML Author

- Download and install Oxygen XML Author from [the Oxygen XML website](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_author/download_oxygenxml_author.html) using the trial licence key that is available for 30 days
- To showcase your technical skills and ability to work with developers, it is a good thing to build a DITA XML documentation portfolio and to have it available on a public Github repository. To do so,  you would have to create an account (if you don't have one already) on Github. If you already have a Github account, you can  [create a new public repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) right away.

##### The workflow steps

- CONCEPTION : What are the main features of the app or the software I am writing the documentation of ? We start by making a simple list of main functions.
- WRITING : Write the content with DITA XML
- PRODUCTION : Generate a PDF file and HTML5 content from the DITA source
- PUBLICATION : Share the content with the end user

##### Creating a DITA map with Oxygen XML Author

Once Oxygen XML is open :
- Create a DITA map by clicking on "file", then "new", then by selecting "DITA map" and by naming your new file with a relevant name
- Create a dedicated folder for your work on the desktop of your computer and make sure all files created in this exercice are included in it
- Create  topic heads elements within this map by right clicking on our new map title, then "append child", then "Topic head"
- Save your work (Crtl S)

##### Designing your content from a simple template

Each page of the documentation should help the user address one specific question. People tend to search on search engines with
