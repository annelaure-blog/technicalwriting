# Technical writing : courses, tools and skills

*Hello ! My name is [Anne-Laure Freant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annelaurefreant/) and I am a content specialist with 10 years of experience in the field of tech 
(in Canada and in France) where I worked for either startups or state-level public institutions on digital products. I used to conduct editorial projects (blogs, SEO, content structuration)
as well as translations of technical content (english to french, french to english) and data or code curation (reading and checking JSON files, completing metadata, etc.). 
So I already have a good set of skills in the field of tech, content and technical writing, and I got into the process of obtaining a technical writing certification in 2022.

I share on this page a list of tools and courses for writing structured content I found useful, as I believe it can help other people interested in technical writing.*
