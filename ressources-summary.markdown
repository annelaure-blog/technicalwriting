# Technical writing and software documentation : courses & trainings

## What this repo is about

*Hello ! My name is [Anne-Laure Freant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annelaurefreant/) and I am a content specialist with 10 years of experience in the field of tech 
(in Canada and in France) where I worked for either startups or state-level public institutions on digital products. I used to conduct editorial projects (blogs, SEO, UX writing) as well as translations of technical content (english to french, french to english) and data or code curation (reading and checking JSON files, completing metadata, etc.). So I already have a good set of skills in the field of tech, content and technical writing, and I got into the process of obtaining a technical writing certification in 2022 so to shift my career towards technical writing full time. My goal is to specialize in software, web apps and API documentation.*

*I share on this repo all my notes from the various trainings and courses I took to improve my technical writing skills as well as getting a certification. Feel free to browse through the content if you are looking for a specific set of skills, a specific topic or course.*
