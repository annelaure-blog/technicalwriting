# Technical writing learning journal

Hi !  I am Anne-Laure Freant and I shifted my career from content management and UX writing to technical writing. To do so, I followed a lot of courses and tutorials
while building my portfolio, with real clients (as a freelance), open source projects and mock-up projects.

This repo contains the files for a static website about all the technical writing ressources I collected while self-learning.
It features a learning journal, notes from courses I took, list of ressources to learn technical writing and documentation as code workflows.

Feel free to reach out to me annelaure.freant@gmail.com if you have any questions.
