# Technical writing learning journal

Hi !  I am [Anne-Laure Freant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annelaurefreant/) and I shifted my career from content management and UX writing to technical writing. To do so, I followed a lot of courses and tutorials while building my portfolio, with real clients (as a freelance), open source projects and mock-up projects.

This repo contains the files for a static website about all the technical writing ressources I collected while self-learning.
It features a learning journal, notes from courses I took, list of ressources to learn technical writing and documentation as code workflows.

Feel free to reach out to me annelaure.freant@gmail.com if you have any questions.

## Documentation as code VS DITA & other methods

There is, in the last years, a cultural shift happening from the DITA standard (structured content with XML) tools and methods to "documentation as code" workflows. The two cultures coexist but seem to be evolving in different professionnal worlds that don't overlap or meet very often.
Most big corporation, especially in the trade & industry business, are used to work with DITA and XML structured content tools (Oxygen XML for instance) to manage heavy documentations to be exported in PDF for prints or as HTML files to publish online, for instance.</br>
Most tech companies, especially API based companies, have adopted "documentation as code" workflows, mainly because developers are often themselves the documentation editors and are used to work with Github, markdown or HTML files as well as static sites and a more open source, collaborative approach. It is also implied that the documentation needs to be online eventually to be usefull to other developers, so it is from the beginning designed as such. </br>
Both methods and tools are interesting to learn, it all depends on what you are interested in. </br>
My project is definitely more on the "documentation as code" culture but I also took courses on DITA and XML to gain basic knowledge.
